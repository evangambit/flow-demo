This project is an ode to

1. Reactive programming: data changes, pure functions compute things, and the UI automatically updates.

2. Vanilla HTML/JavaScript.

I wrote a 600 LoC "Flow" class for automatically computing/propogatig state changes.

This project demonstrates how nice and functional your code can be *without* using virtual DOM frameworks.

Commands:

```
$ npm run build

$ npm run dev
```
